# 🔬 Predicting PSA Levels in Prostate Cancer Using Linear Regression

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates a **multiple linear regression analysis** to predict **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)** levels in men with prostate cancer. PSA is a key biomarker used in diagnosis and monitoring of prostate cancer. The dataset is mock clinical data designed to resemble typical findings in the literature.

The analysis explores how PSA is associated with tumor burden, demographic variables, and diagnostic features.

## 🎯 Objective

To model and interpret how clinical and demographic features contribute to PSA levels using linear regression, and assess the predictive utility of these features.
